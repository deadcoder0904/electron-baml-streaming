# Progress: Electron OCR with BAML

## What Works

- **Project Structure**: The basic Electron project structure is in place with directories for main, renderer, and preload scripts, as well as BAML scripts.
- **Configuration**: Initial configuration files for Electron with Vite, TypeScript, and linting/formatting are set up.
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: The core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created to maintain project context across sessions.

## What's Left to Build

- **OCR Integration**: Integration of an OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract.js) with BAML scripts for processing images and extracting text.
- **User Interface**: Development of a user-friendly UI in the renderer process for image upload, processing, and result display.
- **IPC Communication**: Implementation of secure and efficient communication between main and renderer processes for handling OCR tasks.
- **BAML Execution**: Full integration of BAML script execution within the main process, ensuring it works seamlessly with the chosen OCR engine.
- **Testing and Optimization**: Performance testing for OCR processing and UI responsiveness, along with optimization for resource usage.
- **Deployment**: Configuration for building and packaging the Electron app for distribution across different platforms.

## Current Status

The project is in the early stages of development. The focus has been on setting up the foundational structure and documentation via the memory bank. No functional OCR or UI components have been implemented yet, but the groundwork for further development is established.

## Known Issues

- **OCR Engine Selection**: The specific OCR engine to be used has not been finalized, which could impact BAML script design and integration.
- **Performance Concerns**: Potential performance bottlenecks with OCR processing on less powerful hardware need to be addressed once integration begins.
- **BAML Learning Curve**: Understanding and effectively utilizing BAML for OCR workflows may require additional research or experimentation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup**: Decision to use Electron with Vite for faster development cycles, combined with TypeScript for type safety, setting a strong foundation for a robust desktop application.
- **Documentation Focus**: Early emphasis on creating a comprehensive memory bank to ensure continuity and clarity of project goals and technical decisions across sessions.
- **Future Considerations**: As development progresses, decisions regarding OCR engine selection, UI framework specifics, and BAML integration will shape the project's trajectory, with flexibility to adapt based on testing and user feedback.
