# Active Context: Electron OCR with BAML

## Current Work Focus

The project is in the initialization phase, focusing on setting up the foundational structure and documentation. The memory bank is being established to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core requirements and goals.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the purpose, problems solved, functionality, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps

- Complete the initialization of the memory bank by creating the remaining core files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Review the existing project structure and files (e.g., `baml_src/ocr.baml`, Electron configuration files) to understand the current implementation.
- Begin planning the integration of BAML with Electron for OCR processing, focusing on how to structure the main and renderer processes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Determine the specific OCR engine or library to be used (e.g., Tesseract.js) and how it will be integrated with BAML scripts.
- Consider the user interface design for image upload and text display, ensuring it aligns with the user experience goals outlined in `productContext.md`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintain a clear separation between Electron's main process (handling system-level tasks and BAML execution) and renderer process (handling UI).
- Use modular BAML scripts for OCR tasks to allow for easy updates and customization.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The memory bank structure is critical for maintaining project context, especially given the reset nature of sessions. Each file must be detailed and accurate to ensure effective continuation of work.
