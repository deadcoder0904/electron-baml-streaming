# Product Context: Electron OCR with BAML

## Purpose

The Electron OCR with BAML application is designed to address the need for a reliable, desktop-based solution for Optical Character Recognition. It aims to provide users with the ability to convert scanned documents or images into editable and searchable text, enhancing productivity and accessibility.

## Problems Solved

- **Accessibility**: Many OCR solutions are web-based or require constant internet connectivity. This desktop application allows offline processing, making it accessible in various environments.
- **Customization**: By using BAML, the application can be tailored to specific business needs or workflows, offering flexibility not often found in off-the-shelf OCR software.
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data as it remains on their local machine, addressing privacy concerns associated with cloud-based OCR services.

## Functionality

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in common formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) for OCR processing.
- **Text Extraction**: The application processes images to extract text, supporting multiple languages if possible.
- **Output Options**: Extracted text can be viewed within the app, copied to clipboard, or saved to a file.
- **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive interface that guides users through the process of uploading, processing, and managing OCR results.

## User Experience Goals

- **Ease of Use**: The application should be straightforward, requiring minimal technical knowledge to operate.
- **Speed**: OCR processing should be quick, providing results in a timely manner even on moderate hardware.
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy in text recognition, with options to adjust or correct results if necessary.
- **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback during processing, including progress indicators and error messages if something goes wrong.
