# Project Brief: Electron OCR with BAML

## Overview

This project aims to develop an Electron-based desktop application integrated with BAML (Business Application Markup Language) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. The application will allow users to process images and extract text using OCR technology, providing a seamless desktop experience.

## Core Requirements

- Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron.
- Integrate BAML for defining and executing OCR-related business logic.
- Enable users to upload images and receive text output from OCR processing.
- Ensure the application is user-friendly and efficient in processing.

## Goals

- Create a robust Electron app structure with clear separation between main and renderer processes.
- Implement BAML scripts for OCR tasks, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- Provide a responsive UI for image upload and text display.
- Achieve high accuracy in text extraction from various image formats.

## Scope

The scope includes the development of the Electron application, integration of BAML for OCR, and basic UI/UX design. Advanced features like cloud integration or real-time processing may be considered in future iterations.
